game_bigdata
============

Data was acquired by the wonderfully helpful [Bryan Baugher](http://github.cerner.com/BB021949) and the raw version of it is [here](http://github.cerner.com/BB021949/game_bigdata).  Normally this 
data would be acquired for processing in a more appropriate manner like a live feed or Sqoop but since we don't generally have access to game data
he wrote a scraper.


Description
-----------

This is a repo of data about video games (i.e. names, review scores, units sold...) and scripts used to 
retrieve the data from different sources (metacritic.com, vgchartz.com...).
